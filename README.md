Problem Statement - Enhancing Navigation for Railway Station Facilities and Locations.

Proposed Solution - A comprehensive navigation system was developed to provide real-time directions and passenger's dynamic movements, detailed geographical maps of stations, and accessibility options for all passengers to move to the facilities like Reservation Counter, Waiting Areas, food courts, Retiring rooms etc.
A mobile application was made to meet the needs of Railway Station Navigation and to improve accessibility to it for the passengers.

Mobile app user flow: ✨ 
1. QR Code based user current position.
2. Shortest path between user and the destination facility in the Station.
3. Navigation of passenger upon the path on 2D/3D map of Railway Station.


Features and USP:
📌 Accurate passenger tracking using Augmented Reality(AR).
📌AR implemented through the sensors of the phone Camera sensor, compass and accelerometer.
📌 Static path as well as Dynamic movements of user.
📌Navigation across multiple destinations using a dropdown list.
